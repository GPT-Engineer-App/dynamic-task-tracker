# dynamic-task-tracker

"Create a dynamic web application for managing tasks. The application should allow users to add, update, delete, and view tasks in real-time. It should have intuitive user interfaces for each task operation, interact with a backend service via API calls, and provide live updates without page refreshes.
The
design should be responsive, accessible, and user-friendly."
